#Unlearning

We start learning stuff pretty early. Learning normally doesn't stop. It may slow down, but it is something you can't stop. Along the way we make mistakes. A lot of mistakes. This is a way of learning. We learn from our mistakes, with guidance [1]. Well, we have schools to learn. What happens in schools is something different. But let's fast forward a a few years.

Out of college, most of us join work force. You start learning how things work in a new environment, like a fish trying to figure out where to go in a new river. Along the way, you learn stuff. How to do things the way they should be done, how not to make that stupid decision. Stuff like this. As the time passes, you become more experiencedâ€”Seasoned they say.
