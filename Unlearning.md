#Unlearning

We start learning stuff pretty early. Learning is normally constant. It may slow down, but it is something you can't stop. Along the way we make mistakes. A lot of mistakes. This is a way of learning. We learn from our mistakes, with guidance.[^vygotskyzpd] Well, we have schools to learn. What happens in schools is something different. But let's fast forward for a few years.

Out of college, most of us join work force. You start learning how things work in a new environment, like a fish trying to figure out where to swim in a new river. Along the way, we learn stuff. How to do things the way they should be done, how not to make that stupid decision. Stuff like this. As the time passes, we become more experienced—seasoned they say.

The things we learn help us move forward, step up. I find it interesting that we have to figure out where to put the stuff we learn and try to make sense out of it. (!) There are lots of contradictions in life—one can easily find a counter argument and supporting evidences to an argument. Things we learned before can be harmful. Making decisions based on a fallacy would probably lead to bad decisions. I am not overseeing the power of probability here, you can still have good results based on the false judgments. Judging the newly acquired information happens based on the former learnings. We are generally very prone to false judgment based on not knowing or false knowing—not knowing and false knowing are completely two different things. Although both can harm you, false knowing may harm you more. Just look at the people who lost heir lifetime savings in stock market with a speculation—they did not not know, they just got the wrong tip.

##Reversing the Damage

There is a project management concept which I find very useful, *lessons learned*. Not what did we do great, not how clever we are, but where we screwed up. Learning from past failures is very important, alas we tend to forget this very frequently. What project managers discovered and swear to apply nowadays seem very popular, at least in business. Business people become accustomed to this type of concepts when these concepts start pouring from one collegue's mouth. Business people love fancy words. This is where we mix things up. Just having a final presentation slide with a lessons learned title doesn't make us more clever. On the contrary the more we see them the more blinded we become by these things.

How can be reverse the damage done, if there is such a thing? Is it possible to redeem the results of our this is best decision decisions. There are plenty of things that can't just undo. But starting to learn from our past mistakes may start reversing the damage undone. On the long term, this type of attitude would prevail over just ignoring our screw ups.

We need more of this type of lessons learned concepts and they should be introduced in kindergardens.

##Relearning

Unlearning is not an easy process. Why do we let go our hardly earned knowledge or gathered skill. How to do that is another thing, but let's focus on why should we unlearn. [^unlearn-ref1]

The experiences we had what makes us us. The random thoughts, the accidents, the tears and the laughs. You can't undo experiences—try undoing your last tear. We can however unlearn what we thought was best and replace it with another best. Pretty simple, yes. The application may be painful, most of us stagger changing ideas, shifting through one thought to another. Especially engineers are thought to think in a prescribed way, and solve problems the way that would help them automate decision making process. Putting the newly acquired information to a part of the puzzle may sometimes work. What if the part you choose belong to  different puzzle? What if there is no proper place to put that part into the existing puzzle? You should start asking questions, why doesn't this fit here, how can I fit this here. Try removing a few puzzle parts and placing the new one to test if it would fit.

We need to unlearn stuff pretty fast. When we made mistakes, when that best algorithm you used for years to solve certain types of problems, get rid of it. Doesn't something work anymore, start redefining things.
