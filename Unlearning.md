#Unlearning

We start learning stuff pretty early. Learning is normally constant. It may slow down, but it is something you can't stop. Along the way we make mistakes. A lot of mistakes. This is a way of learning. We learn from our mistakes, with guidance [^vygotsky-zpd]. Well, we have schools to learn. What happens in schools is something different. But let's fast forward for a few years.

Out of college, most of us join work force. You start learning how things work in a new environment, like a fish trying to figure out where to swim in a new river. Along the way, we learn stuff. How to do things the way they should be done, how not to make that stupid decision. Stuff like this. As the time passes, we become more experienced—Seasoned they say.

The things we learn help us move forward, step up. I find it interesting that we have to figure out where to put the stuff we learn and try to make sense out of it. (!) There are lots of contradictions in life—One can easily find a counter argument and supporting evidences to an argument. Things we learned before can be harmful. Making decisions based on a fallacy would probably lead to bad decisions. I am not overseeing the power of probability here, you can still have good results based on the false judgments. Judging the newly acquired information happens based on the former learnings. We are generally very prone to false judgment based on not knowing or false knowing—Not knowing and false knowing are completely two different things. Although both can harm you, false knowing may harm you more. Just look at the people who lost heir lifetime savings in stock market with a speculation—They did not not know, they just got the wrong tip.
