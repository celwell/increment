#How I Work#

Over the years I have developed a routine that I follow every day. This is what works for me. I hope it may inspire some people.

**Morning routine**

I wake up around 6:00 to 6:30. No alarms. I have to wake up by myself. I have breakfast around 7:00. I workout for 15 to 30 minutes.&nbsp;
Before going to work, I review my list and try to find the most important 3 tasks to be accomplished that day.&nbsp;
Mornings are quiet, and I am a morning person. I focus better and accomplish more in the mornings. So I try to cross of as many tasks as I can from my list before going to work.

**Work**

I don't do multitasking. Multitasking is poisonous. I do one thing at a time. I try not to interrupt what I am doing, until I finish it.
Both at work and at my personal life I apply inbox zero rule. If there is any mail pending in my inbox, I do four things. I either reply it, delete it, delegate it. Subsequently, if I am done with it, I send it to archive.
Whatever I do, I try to focus as best as I can. To do so, I try to remove all the clutter, and all disractions while I am working. This is the only way I can work on what matters.
I work in blocks, and use pomodoro technique, which helps me focus on the current task.[1] This motivates me a lot. You will be amazed to see how much you can accomplish if you give yourself to a task for 20 minute without any distraction.
I give small breaks, and in these breaks I do whatever I like, enjoying a coffee with my friends, reading on Quora and Stackoverflow are my favorite break time activities.

**Eating**

I don't like eating alone. I always eat with friends and colleagues.

**Note-taking**

For taking notes I use a squared Moleskine notebook and a black pen. I use a variation of bullet journal, which I developed over the years.[2] For years I used mobile or laptop to take notes, besides paper notes but it easily became very painful to manage these notes without a proper structure. So I developed a framework to manage the notes I take. Mobile note-taking is great. But at some point it is either rude or not practical to use a laptop or a mobile phone to take notes. People would think you are sending a text or just checking e-mail if you are in a meeting. So I started carrying a small notebook with me. Although it is not always very practical to carry an additional notebook with you, it became essential for me. It is very practical when you have an idea if you keep it bed side.

**Tools**

I use evernote to jot down any piece of ideas. I use it whenever possible. From all of my devices. I digitalize any physical stuff as best as I can to avoid clutter and save them to Evernote.
I use GitHub for all the my projects, even for my writings.

I love writing. I use ZenPen web app for writing and use a markdown editor for editing. [3] It displays very cool.

I use Latex for academic writing or whenever I need something fancy looking.

I read articles via RSS. I do a little bit Twitter. I don't do Facebook.

I use a pomodoro app, a very minimalistic one, which just has a counter.

**Night routine**

After dinner, I continue working. Before I go to sleep I have a short workout session which is no more than 15 minutes. This way I feel refreshed and can continue working.
I review my notes before I go to sleep. Both the paper notes I have taken&nbsp;during the day, or the notes taken digitally. I try to clear my inboxes and take the necessary actions for each of these items.

I plan the next day after reviewing my notes. Knowing what I will work on tomorrow lifts a heavy weight on my shoulders.
I try to do one thing for me no matter how tired I am. Reading a book, watching a TV show or writing is among my favorite things. This is very important for me and I try to keep it that way. &nbsp;

**Notes**

[1] [Pomodoro](http://pomodorotechnique.com/) is a technique in which you work for 25 minutes of blocks and give 5 or 15 minutes of breaks.

[2] [Bullet journal](http://www.bulletjournal.com/) is a great method if you fancy note-taking and making lists.

[3] [ZenPen](http://www.zenpen.io/) is the ultimate minimalist web app I found so far for writing. I just write and save as markdown to continue writing offline.

**Thanks** to Kevin McKeown for inspiring me to write this and Evrim Doğanyiğit for reading drafts of this.
